"review_text":"Sam Brinker (2025) <br> A wonderful debut from director/producer duo Allen and Liz Brinker, 2025's SAM BRINKER is a high energy crowd pleaser that is sure to thrill audiences with its... blah blah blah <br> Look, SAM BRINKER is really all you need in a movie. The lead actor captures the charismatic playboy charm like no one else can right now (except for maybe Pedro Pascal). The supporting cast in a venerable who's who of lovable hangers-on, losers, nerds and try hards. <br> But honestly the story only begins to matter when he finds Elisabeth. Their love story is legitimately inspiring, the film captures what it feels like when two people are actually meant for one another, and it's just so fun to watch it all play out. Run don't walk to SAM BRINKER! <br> (Minus half a star for the weird act 3 disco robot sequence)"

"review_text":"I think Roger Ebert said it best in his review of I am Sam-- 'Sam has the kind of problems that come up in story conferences more than in life. For example, he's sitting in a diner when an attractive young woman smiles at him. He smiles back. she comes over and asks him if he would like to have a good time. He says he sure would. Then a cop pounces and arrests him for soliciting a prostitute. Back at the station, the cop admits-- \"this is the first time in 19 ears I actually believe a guy who says he didn't know she was a hooker\"'"
